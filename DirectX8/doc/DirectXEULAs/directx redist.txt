DirectX Software Development Kit Redistributable Code
-------------------------------------------------------------
Redistributable Code is identified as all of the files in the following 
directory on the DirectX 8.0 SDK CD:

   redist/directx8/

All files in the above directory must be included in any distribution of 
the DirectX 8.0 Redistributable Code with the exception of the Broadcast
Driver Architecture cab files:

   bda.cab
   bdant.cab

Both of which are considered optional DirectX 8.0 redistributable 
components and can be removed from your distribution of the DirectX 
8.0 redistributable components.
